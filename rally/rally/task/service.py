    1) Each service method should not be called with positional arguments,
       since it can lead mistakes in wrong order while writing version
       compatible code. We had such situation in KeystoneWrapper
       (see https://review.openstack.org/#/c/309470/ ):

       .. code-block:: python

           class IdentityService(Service):
               def add_role(self, role_id, user_id, project_id):
                   self._impl(role_id, user_id, project_id)

           class KeystoneServiceV2(Service):
               def add_role(self, user_id, role_id, project_id):
                   pass

           class KeystoneServiceV3(Service):
               def add_role(self, role_id, user_id, project_id):
                   pass

       Explanation of example: The signature of add_role method is
       different in KeystoneServiceV2 and KeystoneServiceV3. Since
       IdentityService uses positional arguments to make call to
       self._impl.add_role, we have swapped values of role_id and user_id in
       case of KeystoneServiceV2.

       Original code and idea are taken from `positional` library.

    2) We do not need keep atomics for some actions, for example for inner
       actions (until we start to support them). Previously, we used
       "atomic_action" argument with `if atomic_action` checks inside each
       method. To reduce number of similar if blocks, let's write them in one
       place, make the code cleaner and support such feature for all service
       methods.
