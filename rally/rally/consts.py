"""
There is a lot of situation when we would like to work with Enum or consts.
E.g. work around Tasks. We would like to use Enum in DB to store status of task
and also in migration that creates DB and in business logic to set some status
so to avoid copy paste or direct usage of enums values we create singletons
for each enum. (e.g TaskStatus)
